# Hackpad

https://hackpad.hackclub.com/ <- website is live! This is probably a better place to start

## Overview
This is a limited-time YSWS (you ship, we ship) program where *you* design your own macropad, and we'll ship you the parts you need to build it, for free! This is something you definitely don't want to miss out, so make sure to join #hackpad in the slack!

### You ship:
- A PCB Design and schematic
- Files for the case in .STEP format
- Firmware for the keyboard. You are allowed to use QMK or other pre-existing firmware!

### We'll send you:
- A custom Hack Club hackpad kit! Components can be found [here](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/parts)
- A $15 card grant to get your PCB ordered from JLCPCB, and a 3D printed case from [printing legion!](printlegion.hackclub.com)

Find out more at hackpad.hackclub.com!

## Contributing

The repo has gotten really big over the past year as old submissions used to go to the repo directly, so I recommend only cloning the most recent commit (with the old macropads removed):

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hackclub/hackpad
```

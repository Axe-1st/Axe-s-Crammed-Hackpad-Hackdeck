# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to the FAQ section! If you have something you think should be added here please ping @alexren in the #hackpad channel

{/* **When is the deadline?** \
Same deadline as Highway! July 31st, but PLEASE don't hold it until then! */}

**What gets shipped to me?**
- A kit of all the parts in the [Kit Contents page](/parts)!
- a $15 HCB Card grant to get your **PCB** made, and a case 3D printed from [printing legion](https://www.printlegion.hackclu.com/) if needed!
- a $18 HCB Card grant to get your soldering iron, if you need one. This is non-transferrable.

**What is an HCB Card grant??** \
[READ ME](/cardgrant) FOR INFO

**Where can I find KiCAD footprints / what's the measurement for this thing / etc** \
A lot of these questions can be answered by checking out the [resources and tips section](/resources)! You can find **KiCAD footprints**, 3D models, etc

**Can I use a microcontroller other than the XIAO RP2040?** \
Unfortunately not for hackpad! If you want to use a custom microcontroller, you'll have to submit it as a custom project to Blueprint.

The XIAO is a great primer and I recommend using it, but it's totally understandable if you want to do something more advanced! We won't stop you :)

{/* **What's new with v2?** \
Lots of stuff! Updated list of requirements, more content, and other goodies - the big thing is that after making a macropad, you can design and submit an entire ***keyboard*** to be made! */}

{/* **Do *I* have to make a macropad before making a keyboard?** \
Absolutely! A keyboard is *significantly* harder to design, and so its a prerequisite you understand the fundamentals with a macropad first. You don't need to wait for it to come though! You can start your keyboard as soon as its approved */}

**Will my hackpad come assembled?** \
Unfortunately not! Not to fear though - assembling a macropad 

**Can I use acrylic/cnc metal/etc for the case/plate?** \
NO! Only 3D prints are supported.

**Can I use parts outside of the approved list?** \
Yes! You are responsible for sourcing it on your own money though.

**Where will everything be shipped from?** \
It'll be shipped from [Hack Club HQ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EPwC2izABPnbVgjq9), which is located in Shelburne, Vermont USA.

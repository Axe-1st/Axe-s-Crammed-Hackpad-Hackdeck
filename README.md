# Axe-s-Crammed-Hackpad-Hackdeck
-This is my own Hackdeck! (maybe i should call it hackdecky)

-If you were wondering why did i make it like this? I made it so i can move more easily in cad than rather keep on holding on my scroll wheel. I plan to add lots of lots of custom presets with its own Firmware and custom app "if i have time thou"



## What it has:
-1x Rotary encoder

-1x 128x32 OLED Display

-4x SK6812 MINI-E LEDs

-8x macro keys (planning to make lots modes/presets)

-worst pcb routing ever


## What it should look like:


-This is My Hackydecky!


-"Please ignore why is there so many colors it should be Black of White!"

-"Also ignore why is the Xiao rp2040 placed on the top layer on the pcb not on the bottom"

-inside

## PCB:

-2 Layers

-Front

-Back

## Schematic:


-I had a hard time understanding what a matrix, but in the end some reference photos helped me learn how to. Now my problem is how do i code a matrix :hs: ...

## CAD Files/ CAD Case:

-I made this Case from scratch! 

-I used onshape to make this and i will hate Constraints from now on. 

-I used an STL file of my pcb so i can trace the holes as well.


-Top Part/Cover


-If you noticed why does the top layer have no screw holes?


-Don't worry i have fixed it in my latest commit

-Bottom Part

-as you can see i added cutouts for led and usb port. I also added screw mounting holes


-Made in onshape!

## Firmware:


-So currently right now the firmware i have is for Flashing the leds non stop.


-for sure i will add all of my codes when i start asembly


## BOM:


-Here is all of the Bill of materials to make your own hackdeck as well!
